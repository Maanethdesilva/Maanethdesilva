I’m a third-year student at the University of Toronto majoring in Computer Science and specializing in the Software Engineering stream. I love expanding my knowledge and applying it in personal projects, hackathons, and professionally to exceed expectations. I have used my technical skills to develop SaaS enterprise software used by millions of users globally. Some of my hobbies are making art and animating.
